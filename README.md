The code performs support vector regression-lesion symptom mapping (SVR-LSM) analysis. Each script performs the analysis on a different data type as follow:
# 00Final_FlipBrainLesions_L_to_R.py                          
code for flipping the left brain lesion to the right side
# 00Final_Permutation_parcel.py                    
code for parcel damage-based SVR-LSM analysis
# 00Final_Permutation_parcelDisconnection.py
code for parcel-to-parcel disconnection based SVR-LSM analysis
# 00Final_Permutation_parcel_BrainMaps.py
code for plotting brain maps from parcel-damage based SVR-LSM 
# 00Final_Permutation_tract.py                         
code for tract disconnection based SVR-LSM analysis
